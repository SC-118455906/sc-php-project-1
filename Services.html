               <p> Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality is up and coming technology that is going to change how we do everyday things </br>
                   Virtual Reality involves placing the user in a virtual area where they see virtual objects but do not interact with the area they are actually standing in</br>
                   Augmented Reality allows the user to see virtual objects in the real-life area they are standing in/ interact with items in a way that would not be possible without AR </br>
                   These both have huge business potential such as having a virtual meeting with colleagues in the same virtual space while being miles apart in real life or else see how an object might look in a room or a certain location </br>
                   Cronin Tech. has a vast knowledge of VR and AR as they have been using these technologies for many years now and will use this experience to deliver a high-quality solution to you. </br>
